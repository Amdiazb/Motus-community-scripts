# Motus community scripts
a repository for Motus users to share their R scripts for working with Motus data

## Overview

Motus is by nature a collaborative endeavour. This repository provides a place for users to share their R scripts with the Motus community so that others can benefit from scripts they have developed to perform common tasks with Motus data or for users to find code that can serve as a building block for their own analyses. Anyone is welcome to submit scripts and we encourage everyone to make use of this repository.
