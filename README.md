# Motus community scripts
a repository for Motus users to share their R scripts for working with Motus data

## Overview

Motus is by nature a collaborative endeavour. This repository provides a place for users to share their R scripts with the Motus community so that others can benefit from scripts they have developed to perform common tasks with Motus data or for users to find code that can serve as a building block for their own analyses. Anyone is welcome to submit scripts and we encourage everyone to make use of this repository.

## Instructions

### Summary

1. Fork this repository into your own github account
  
2. Create a new folder with the topic of your script(s) (e.g. stopover length)

3. Commit your changes to github

4. Make a pull request when you are ready to share your script(s)

**Notes:**

* If you would prefer not to use GitHub, you can submit a zip file with your script, instructions, and any associated files to motus@birdscanada.org and we will upload it to the repository.

* If you previously forked the Motus repository to make earlier changes and are now making new changes later, you should keep your fork current in case others have made changes in the interim to the repository.
